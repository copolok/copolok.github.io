        <p>My name is Vera Dolce. I am 78 years old, and I am the grandmother to Bella, Alessia, and Aria. I love to share with my granddaughters, but I have been unable to see them in person since quarantine began. We decided that it would be good for me to connect with them and the people in my community this way! <br><br>Here you will find <a href=https://www.pastagrannies.com>recipes</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vm6oaYzHyA>videos on hobbies you can pick up</a>, <a href=www.facebook.com>community news and connectivity, </a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/goldretrieverus?lang=en</p> fun tidbits about my dog, Lord Byron.</a></p>

    <p>This is Lord Byron. He is now 7 years old. He is getting to be an old man!<br><br>If you don't walk him, he gets broody like his namesake. We have been doing lots of quarantine walks when we can, of course being careful as my granddaughters insist we do. Sometimes we sit outside and I read him some Lord Byron, which I think is very funny. His favorite poem is <a href=https://poets.org/poem/epitaph-dog>Epitaph to a Dog.</a> He also does enjoy watching a video with me once in a while. We have been doing lots of this in quarantine. Here are some he recommends:<br><br><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjTDnV5fK5s>Video 1</a><br><br><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDbpdSFW5TY>Video 2</a><br><br><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgncaI0HDpY>Video 3</a><br><br><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buleTXAUJGM>Video 4</a><br><br><a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtGuWWn_pB8>Video 5</a></p>

        <p>You should make gnocchi when you get the chance. We've all got time now, sitting about! It is always a good time to eat pasta and potatoes in the same dish. They're the two best things in the world! Why not! I made gnocchi last week. My own mother showed me how to make gnocchi when I was young, maybe ten. I was terrible when I first tried it! I boiled the water all over and burnt the pasta in the pan. This time, of course, Lord Byron kept careful watch of me. I was too tired to pull out cookbooks, so I just looked into Bon Appetit. Here's the recipe if you wanted to try it:<br><a href= https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/gnocchi-sage-butter-parmesan>Gnocchi with Sage and Parmesan</a><br> I sent some over to my neighbor, Jane Randall, (yes, after chlorox-wiping the pot, Alessia) and she gave me a thumbs up through her window! I sent her a funny <a href= https://www.huffpost.com/entry/make-pasta-like-italian-nonnas_n_5b9bf0f8e4b013b0977a7d01>article </a> too, because Jane almost loves pasta more than I do. We laughed about it from our respective lawns. What strange times we're in, but I'm glad we can still celebrate funny things together!</p>

        <p>My granddaughter Bella fell in love with this Fortnite game last year, and she used to joke with me that I should play. I never played many video games with my grandchildren because they always intimidated me a little. I did play some Mario Kart. But everyone loves Mario Kart, right? Well, anyway, now many months into quarantine, I have decided to play! Why not! It can be a little frightening at times, but I must say, I think I'm getting quite good. If you'd like, I have a few videos that helped me get started that I can share with you!<br><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEFV_906bPw>Video 1</a><br><a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzRt87pptUo> Video 2</a><br><a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FehINTf9a_4>Video 3</a> </p>

        <p>I had to recently pronounce the death of my birdfeeder. There was this mad squirrel that would come and jump on it everyday to try to steal some of the seed, and I'm convinced that devil was what did it in. I awoke one morning to find the feeder lying on the ground, the wire all twisted up. It was really quite sad. The birdfeeder served me well over the years. But, it gave me an excuse to buy a hummingbird feeder! What an amazing thing to have. The hummers are wonderful companions alongside Lord Byron. They zip in and out, but it's always such a joy to watch them. I snapped this picture of one the other day. They're truly amazing creatures! Here are some links on hummingbirds and what to know if you decide to get a hummingbird feeder too!<br><a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v359ESlVfNw>Hummingbird Documentary</a><br><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey3E6uLXjMc>Hummingbird Facts</a><br><a href= https://www.birdsandblooms.com/birding/attracting-hummingbirds/13-questions-hummingbird-feeders-answered-pros/> Hummingbird Feeder Info</a></p>

        <p>My daughter sent me this anthology, and it has been so wonderful to read it with Lord Byron. Since we are being asked to stay inside to preserve the health of others and ourselves, why not read a book or the work of some wonderful poets! Lord Byron has taken a liking to the work of Wordsworth in this anthology, which is rather astonishing. We read some over our dinner the other day and he seemed particularly enthralled, although I have an inkling that that had more to do with the fact that I was eating some chicken over homemade pasta. You should definitely look into investigating the romantic poets and/or reading more poetry books.<br><a href=https://interestingliterature.com/2018/07/10-of-the-best-poems-by-english-romantic-poets/>Romantic Poets</a><br><a href= https://www.amazon.com/Forage-Penguin-Poets-Rose-McLarney/dp/0143133195/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8A26SAECOSJ6&dchild=1&keywords=forage+rose+mclarney&qid=1590566730&sprefix=forage+rose%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-1>"Forage" by Rose McLarney</a><br><a href=https://medium.com/anomalyblog/3-free-poetry-chapbooks-to-read-this-summer-from-agape-editions-ababbfab48e7>Free Chapbooks</a></p>
