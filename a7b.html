    <p style="color:Tomato;">POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. &ndash; One lifeguard will sit perched on a tall wooden chair. Two others, maintaining distance, will stand sentinel on the beach below.</p>
   <p style="color:Tomato;">All three will wear scarflike masks and carry face shields and respirators equipped with new HEPA filters.</p>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">They will patrol a beach that a town engineer determined can hold precisely 197 groups in zones roughly 18-feet square, allowing six feet of space in between.</p>
   <p style="color:Tomato;">&#147;We&#39;re trying to make sure that we can safely open as much as possible, as quickly as possible,&#148; said Paul M. Kanitra, the mayor of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., about 70 miles south of New York City. &#147;And that we don&#39;t misstep too early.&#148;</p>
